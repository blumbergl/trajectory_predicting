# trajectory_predicting

Types:

- Rule
  - Like a tree: If (inRectangle 0 0 10 10) (accelerate 0 9.81)
  - There are types here: like, inRectangle expects four numbers and outputs a boolean

- Thing
  - Like a circle; just anything that goes in a scene
 
- Need a method that applies a Rule to a scene (a list of Things?)
